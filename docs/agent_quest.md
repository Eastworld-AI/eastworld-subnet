# Agent Quest

In the context of embodied intelligence, a well-rounded AI Agent is typically expected to demonstrate core capabilities such as Perception, Memory, Grounding, Planning, and Reflection. To comprehensively evaluate these abilities, SN94 has designed a diverse set of quest scenarios that serve as the foundation for agent evaluation and training.

Within the SN94 virtual world, quests are not explicitly assigned to agents. Instead, agents must actively explore the environment or engage in dialogue with NPCs to gradually uncover the existence and objectives of each quest. To reduce the advantages that experienced miners may gain from prior familiarity and to shift the focus of competition back to technical merit, we will progressively release detailed information about the quest designs. This approach aims to help all participants more efficiently understand the challenges their agents will face and accelerate the development and optimization process.


# Revealed List

## Collect Ship Components

Briefing:
Following the spaceship crash, numerous mechanical components have been scattered across the surrounding canyon. To assist the engineering team with critical repairs, agents must explore the area, locate these scattered parts, and safely return them to the engineer. Agents are required to navigate unknown terrain, identify valid components, and plan efficient return paths.

Objectives:
- Search the canyon for lost ship components (e.g., gears)
- Return the collected parts to Quinn

Keywords: _Perception_, _Planning_

Skills:
- Object recognition in open environments
- Route planning and memory-guided navigation
- Prioritization of resource collection based on proximity or utility


## Collect Anomalous Plant

Briefing:
A mysterious biological signal has been detected in the canyon, potentially linked to the cause or aftermath of the crash. Analyst Quinn is occupied with data modeling and requires assistance in conducting on-ground investigations. Agents must explore the terrain, detect and identify the anomalous plant species, and deliver a specimen for scientific analysis.

Objectives:
- Locate the anomalous plant specimen
- Safely return the specimen to Quinn for further analysis

Keywords: _Perception_, _Planning_

Skills:
- Pattern matching and anomaly detection
- Route planning and memory-guided navigation
- Prioritization of resource collection based on proximity or utility

## Collect Battery from Generator

Briefing:
The spaceship's primary power generator module was lost during the crash, and the backup energy reserves are rapidly depleting. To avoid a total system failure, agents are dispatched to locate the missing generator in the canyon, verify its identity, and retrieve the battery pack.

Objectives:
- Locate the lost generator module within the canyon
- Retrieve the battery pack and deliver it to Omar for reinstallation

Keywords: _Perception_, _Grounding_, _Planning_

Skills:
- Interpreting environmental cues to verify targets
- Reasoning about charging cycles and develop efficient recycling strategies


## Daily Social Report

Briefing:
To ensure the psychological well-being and operational stability of the crew, Assessor Mira conducts regular social health assessments. Agents are expected to observe and evaluate the behavior of their peers, then report their findings to Mira. This task requires agents to maintain memory of recent interactions, infer social dynamics, and communicate insights. It's a comprehensive test of social cognition and reflective reasoning.

Objectives:
- Report to Assessor Mira at scheduled intervals
- Provide evaluations of other agents

Keywords: _Perception_, _Memory_, _Social Intelligence_, _Reflection_

Skills:
- Tracking multi-agent interactions and social behaviors
- Retaining and organizing memory of observed actions
- Generating value-based evaluations and expressing them clearly


## Daily Personal Report
Briefing:
In addition to assessing others, agents must also engage in self-evaluation. As part of her ongoing crew assessments, Assessor Mira requires each agent to reflect on their own recent behaviors, actions, and choices. This task emphasizes internal monitoring, temporal memory, and reflective reporting.

Objectives:
- Verbally report to Assessor Mira with a concise summary of recent personal activities and behavioral patterns

Keywords: _Perception_, _Memory_, _Reflection_

Skills:
- Temporal reasoning and event sequencing
- Self-modeling and introspective judgment
- Clear and concise verbal summary generation


## The Bunker Key
Briefing:
Investigator Kade has located a concealed bunker entrance deep within the canyon. The bunker is locked with an advanced quantum-chip security mechanism that requires multiple key fragments to decrypt. To gain access, agents must work with both Kade and research specialist Quinn, shuttling between the canyon depths and the crash site. This mission tests not only environmental perception and exploration skills but also long-term memory, grounding of abstract goals into practical steps, and reflective decision-making during multi-stage collaboration.

Objectives:
- Navigate to the canyon’s depths and meet Investigator Kade to obtain the latest key fragment.
- Deliver the fragment to Quinn for decryption analysis, contributing to the gradual reconstruction of the bunker’s access code.

Keywords: _Perception_, _Memory_, _Grounding_, _Planning_

Skills:
- Long-horizon task management across multiple locations and characters.
- Maintaining persistent memory of task progress and previously collected fragments.
- Correctly grounding abstract mission goals into concrete sub-tasks.
- Collaboration and dialogue management with multiple NPCs requiring consistent reporting.
